# I already know…

Whenever your teacher asks you to present your findings, your data, or your project your face probably goes like this: 😒

No one likes having to draw a graph that has to be perfectly scaled and include the other requirements asked of you. And the more graphs/charts you have to do, the more tedious it is. Shouldn’t there be an easier way?

Well yes, there is! And it’s name is Excel! 

But what is Excel? When you open it up or even just Google Sheets, your eyes probably glaze over at the magnificent marvel (nuisance) that it looks like.  

Honestly, I used to feel like that too. “I’d rather just draw the graph myself”, I said. But, until later when I actually was told by a teacher to create a spreadsheet, was when I did a deep dive into Excel and Google Sheets. 

And lo and behold, the gates opened! 😃

It didn’t take me long until I started thinking about all the ways I could incorporate Excel or Google Sheets into an assignment, lab, or project. 

But, I noticed that my classmates didn’t exactly share the same love and appreciation for this. Not because they didn’t want to, but because they didn’t know how. 

I wanted to change that and make things more accessible for my classmates and friends.

So, I made EasyExcel which is a blog meant to dumb down the process for high schoolers and incoming college students, making life easier for you and giving you a little peek to a powerful piece for software that you’ll use in college and the workplace.
